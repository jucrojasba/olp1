    <p>--ph-- I am often seen between the cause and its effect, linding action to purpose and sometimes
    I help summarize too many plus</p>
    <p>A challenge that every solver faces, yet no problem is left unturned by me. What am I?</p>
    <p>When not present, everything is chaos; when overused, a hindrance. What balance must I maintain?</p>
    <p>Not seen, but felt, where mysteries dwell and answers are sought. What am I?</p>
    <p>A puzzle or a game, a test or life itself; what am I?</p>
    <p>Not everything is that hard, the word here is But!</p>
    <p>A greeting or a question, often the start of something more. What am I?</p>
    <p>Endless queries, seeking truths. What do I do?</p>
    <p>A possession, a necessity, or a gift from life. What could I be?</p>
    <p>The smallest story, yet entirely unique. What am I?</p>
    <p>To give wisdom or skills, often without a school. What is my action?</p>
    <p>The collective of experience, learning, and growth. Who are these?</p>
    <p>Extended periods, often leading to wisdom. What are these?</p>
    <p>From shocks, I rebound; an archetype of durability. What am I?</p>
    <p>Two truths, one existence; what am I?</p>
    <p>Unlocks doors to success, often held but not seen. What am I?</p>
    <p>The ultimate aim, but not without its trials. What is it?</p>
    <p>The journey, the struggle, the joy. What is this?</p>
    <p>A model of decision-making, often invisible but ever-present. What is it?</p>
    <p>Unseen, untouchable, but surrounds us all. What am I?</p>
    <p>A filter, a window, or a deception. What could I be?</p>
    <p>Often a tool, sometimes a trick. What am I?</p>
    <p>An invitation to observe, to learn, to grow. What am I suggesting?</p>
    <p>We belong, we thrive, we live. Where are we?</p>
    <p>More than an event, itâ€™s a journey. What is it?</p>
